"""As an exercise,  write a correct version of increment that doesnâ€™t contain any loops.

Skills:
-OOP
-Manipulating time objects and variables

Status: Complete

Personal notes: This is version that wasn't working. I was confusing myself with the following:
 -Conversion of just the increment and then forgetting to take into account the start time
 -Not realising that I should start from top to bottom i.e. go to hours, figure out the remainder etc
 -Trying to do all the steps together

I was finally able to solve it (in a long way) by breaking down the problem. Sample code at the end.
