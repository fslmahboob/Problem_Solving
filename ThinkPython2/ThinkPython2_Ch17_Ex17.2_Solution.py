"""This exercise is a cautionary tale about one of the most common, and difficult to
find, errors in Python. Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the methods:
1.  An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an empty list.
2.  A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds it to pouch_contents.
3.  A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object and the
contents of the pouch.

Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables named kanga and
roo, and then adding roo to the contents of kangaâ€™s pouch.

-OOP

Download http: // thinkpython2. com/ code/ BadKangaroo. py . It contains a solution to the
previous problem with one big, nasty bug. Find and fix the bug

class Kangaroo:

        self.name = name
        self.pouch_contents = contents

In Python, default arguments are evaluated once when the function is created. 
This won't be noticed with immutable datatypes but it is a noticeable problem in mutable datatypes.
But if it set to None, it is evaluated once but it is not mutable. 
So it is not getting changed everytime the function is being run.

This code can be fixed by setting contents = None and then an if-else statement like this:

    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
        self.name = name
        if contents is None:
            contents = []
        self.pouch_contents = contents
