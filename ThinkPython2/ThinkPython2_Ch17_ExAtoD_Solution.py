"""Exercise 17.0A: As an exercise, rewrite time_to_int (from Section 16.4) as a method. 
You might be tempted to rewrite int_to_time as a method, too, but that doesnâ€™t really
 make sense because there would be no object to invoke it on. """

Exercise 17.0B: As an exercise, rewrite an init method for the Point class that takes x and y as optional
parameters and assigns them to the corresponding attributes.

Exercise 17.0C: As an exercise, write a str method for the Point class. Create a Point object and print it.

Exercise 17.0D: Write an add method for the Point Class
