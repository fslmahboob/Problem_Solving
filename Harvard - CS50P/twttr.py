"""CS50P: Problem Set 2: Just setting up my twttr
Link: https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/2/twttr/

When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to
save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was
originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a
program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs
that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted,
whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

Skills:
 -loops
 -conditional
 -list methods
